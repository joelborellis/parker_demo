Contract Variation (Sub-Process). Go to Section 8.End3. Contract Life Cycle Management b. Process Steps: The following table outlines the steps of the Contract Management process: Step No. Step Title Description 1 Start (Contract Handover) Pursuant to CC.PRO.002 Contracting- Drilling & Well Services process, P&L Manager and other GM and Divisional Operational and Finance personnel participate in a formal contract handover meeting conducted by the Negotiating Team. Note: CCM personnel or GM CM create a contract record in Salesforce for the new Revenue Contract. In addition GM CM, or individual assigned this responsibility, may develop a contract briefing document that summarizes essentials of the Revenue Contract, key contract clauses, responsibilities and obligations of the parties. Such contract briefing document may include actions and rationale behind some non-standard clauses, specific requirements, clarification of certain aspects of contract or project, layouts of the processes describing how changes will be managed and disputes will be handled and resolved. Although development of contract briefing document as a quick reference guide is a good contract management practice, this is an optional activity. 2 Joint Contract Kick-Off Meeting with Customer (Optional) As may be required, a joint contract kick-off meeting shall take place at the outset of operations under the new Revenue Contract engaging the participants from customer\u2019s organization. Typically, these meetings are warranted by customers, but are generally considered to be a good contract and commercial management practice. A joint contract kick-off meeting will feature discussion of the same contractual highlights, which are covered during the internal handover of contract from the Negotiating team to GM\u2019s Divisional Operational personnel, and engage personnel from both sides who had been actively involved in negotiation of the contract and going forward will be primarily responsible for its performance. Joint contract kick-off meetings may be helpful from the perspective of achieving better alignment with customer\u2019s expectations and obtaining an understanding of customer\u2019s priorities during the contract performance. If kick-off meeting takes place, notes capturing salient points of the meeting shall be prepared and posted in SharePoint and Salesforce. Note: Joint contract kick-off meetings are advisable, but are not mandatory. 3 Contract Life Cycle Management Both GM P&L Manager and GM CM shall continuously interact in any and all contract management tasks and activities. As P&L Manager is ultimately responsible for operational performance and financial results under a specific contract, he/she is formally responsible for day-to-day management of the Revenue Contract assigned to him/her. GM CM shall act as a primary facilitator for the contract management process and provide an oversight of all contractual matters related to a specific Revenue Contract. GM CM interfaces with: \uf0b7 Internal stakeholders on all issues pertinent to the Revenue Contract. \uf0b7 His/her counterparts within the customer\u2019s organization on matters related to the contract management and contract variation. Day-to-day management of the Revenue Contract includes working with internal stakeholders on clarifications they may have with regard to application or interpretation of certain contractual terms, provisions or deliverables pertinent to their functions, timely preparation of reports required under such Revenue Contract, addressing any developing issues and", "1": "disputes, including disputed invoices, etc. Note: Activities associated with contract management are often diverse, but would typically include activities described in Steps 3A through 3D below. Additionally, Steps 3A, 3B and 3C may not necessarily be present in every contract, or happen in sequence provided in this document. Step 3D is always present and follows the others. 3A Dispute Resolution Any disputes with customer that may arise in the course of performance of the Revenue Contract shall be resolved in accordance with protocol set out in corresponding provisions of the contract applicable to dispute resolution. Every attempt shall be made to resolve a dispute in an amicable fashion and in the spirit of retaining good relations with the customer. Together with GM CM, P&L Manager shall be responsible for leading any dispute processes by engaging with Support Functions as required. 3B Contract Audits Revenue Contracts and related contract management activities may be audited both externally (i.e. during audits initiated by customer) and internally. Wherever the Revenue Contract provides for audit by customer, GM CM shall act as a primary focal point for interfacing with customer\u2019s auditing team and shall be supported by Director CCM, or designee, Corporate CCM personnel and other Support Functions, as required. Internal contract audits may be initiated by Corporate CCM personnel and will be conducted pursuant to the internally established procedure. 3C Contract Variation (Sub-Process) A typical Revenue Contract may require certain variations over the contract life cycle. Note: For discrete steps and activities associated with contract variation, which shall be viewed as a sub-process of Contract Management process, please refer to Section 8. 3D Contract Close-Out During the contract close-out phase, P&L Manager shall ensure that all PW\u2019s contract obligations have been fulfilled and customer has paid in full for the entire scope of work/services performed and there are no outstanding invoices. Conversely, any invoice issues have to be cleared or escalated to the attention of appropriate PW\u2019s officer in accordance with GM\u2019s divisional organization structure before the contract close-out. All surviving contract obligations (confidentiality, warranty, etc.) shall be completed and accounted for. 4 Post-Contract Customer Review & Lessons Learned Upon completion of the Revenue Contract, either due to termination or upon expiry of the contract term, GM BD/Sales shall conduct a formal close-out interview with customer to obtain customer\u2019s feedback on contract/project experience. Salient points of customer\u2019s feedback or minutes of meeting, if a formal exit meeting is held, shall be posted in Salesforce and SharePoint. Additionally GM CM and GM BD/Sales shall develop a summary of lessons learned from the contract performance and publish it in SharePoint. 5 End End of Process 7.

Variation Document Distribution15. Contract Management Process b. Process Steps: The following table outlines the steps of the Contract Variation sub-process: Step No. Step Title Description 1 Start Over the life cycle of Revenue Contract, certain changes to contractual terms and conditions may become necessary. Variations may be either externally initiated (customer-requested changes) or internally initiated (changes requested by internal stakeholders). 2 Receive Request for Contract Variation GM CM or GM BD/Sales as per GM\u2019s internal decision: Shall act as a focal point for collecting any requests for contract variation, initiated either externally or internally. Should any requests be received by GM Divisional Operational personnel, the requests shall be forwarded to GM CM or GM BD/Sales depending on who has been assigned by the GM to act as a focal point. 3 Evaluate & Assess Upon receipt of the request for contract variation, GM CM and/or GM BD/Sales shall engage with Support Functions, as required, to evaluate and assess the requested change. GM CM and GM BD/Sales shall keep GM P&L Manager updated on communications regarding the request. A requested variation may be due to: \uf0b7 Changing business environment or needs; \uf0b7 Organizational restructure within either customer\u2019s or internal organization; \uf0b7 Changes to scope of work; \uf0b7 Changes in laws and regulations including changes in interpretation of laws and regulations; \uf0b7 Changes in regulatory requirements; or \uf0b7 Prerequisite terms and conditions of the contract (e.g. annual or event-based adjustments of contract compensation structure). A requested variation shall be evaluated and assessed from the perspective of its potential impact on program duration, contract term, changes in scope of work, and ultimately cost, and as a minimum reviewed by the following Support Functions: \uf0b7 GM/Corporate Operations; \uf0b7 GM/Corporate Finance; \uf0b7 GM/Corporate CCM; and \uf0b7 GM/Corporate Legal Department. Should the requested variation potentially have a material effect on commerciality of the Revenue Contract, profitability assumptions, or substantially alters or deviates from the risk profile of the Revenue Contract as previously assessed and approved, P&L Manager shall engage with GM VP for consultations and approval. Depending on materiality of the change and in accordance with applicable Delegation of Authority standard, GM VP may be required to escalate the assessment of requested variation to an appropriate organizational levels and receive approval(s) of the authorized officer(s). 4 Is the Requested Change Acceptable? Subject to completion of assessment of the change at appropriate organizational levels and contingent upon securing necessary approval(s) by the authorized officer(s) as described above in Step 3, GM P&L Manager shall determine if the requested change is acceptable. \uf0b7 If YES, go to Step 5 \uf0b7 If NO, go to Step 14 5 Draft (or Review) the Proposed Variation When a request for variation comes from customer (originates externally) and a draft of the proposed variation to the Revenue Contract has been provided by the customer, GM CM must always initiate review of the proposed draft by GM/Corporate CCM and GM/Corporate Legal Department and engage Support Functions as required. GM CM shall document any counter-proposed changes or observations (if any) to the draft document and the rationale behind such. Conversely, when a request originates internally, GM CM shall draft a proposed variation document and circulate it for review by P&L Manager and Support Functions as may be necessary to obtain their input. GM CM shall modify the draft pursuant to the comments and observations provided by the P&L Manager and Support Functions in the course of such review. In the event variation increases risk exposure under the existing Revenue Contract, the proposed draft, or counter-draft, of the variation document, as the case may be, shall be reviewed at appropriate organizational levels and approved by the authorized officer(s) in accordance with applicable Delegation of Authority standard. 6 Revert to Customer GM CM formally communicates PW\u2019s proposed draft, or counter-draft, of the variation document to the customer. GM CM shall make a record in Salesforce and post any relevant documents in SharePoint in the directory of the relevant Revenue Contract. Following the submission, GM CM, or GM BD/Sales (as necessary), shall remain in contact with the customer in case customer needs clarifications with regard to the essence of the proposed variation to the Revenue Contract. 7 Accepted by Customer? Is the variation document acceptable to the customer as submitted? \uf0b7 If YES, go to Step 11 \uf0b7 If NO, go to Step 8 8 Negotiate If negotiation of the variation document is required, GM CM, or GM BD/Sales (as necessary), shall engage with P&L Manager and Support Functions or Negotiating Team to negotiate variation document. During negotiation of variation document, guidelines of Contracting Process shall apply and GM CM, GM BD/Sales, P&L Manager and other Support Functions shall be governed by the principles set forth in CC.PRO.002 \u2013 Contracting. 9 Agreement Reached? Has an agreement on variation to the Revenue Contract been reached? \uf0b7 If YES, go to Step 11 \uf0b7 If NO, go to Step 10 10 Continue Negotiations? P&L Manager in consultations with GM CM, GM BD/Sales and other Support Functions or Negotiating Team, if established, determines whether or not to continue with negotiations. \uf0b7 If YES, go to Step 8 \uf0b7 If NO, go to Step 14 11 Execute Variation Document GM CM jointly with the customer prepares the final version of the negotiated variation document for execution. GM CM shall distribute such version of the variation document to GM/Corporate CCM and GM/Corporate Legal Departments for final sign-off. Unless alternative signing sequence has been agreed with the customer, company officer (or designee) with a signing authority for contracting entity executes variation document, which is then co-executed by the customer\u2019s authorized representative or his/her designee. GM CM or GM BD/Sales creates a record in Salesforce summarizing the introduced changes and providing the link to the SharePoint directory containing the executed document. 12 Variation Document Distribution GM CM: \uf0b7 Distributes executed variation document to P&L Manager and other GM and Divisional Operations and Finance personnel responsible for contract execution; \uf0b7 With the assistance of GM BD/Sales, engages with P&L Manager, GM and Divisional Operations and Finance as necessary to ensure understanding of the variation document (overview of the scope of work, roles and responsibilities, deliverables, etc.) 13 Close Out Contract Variation GM CM: \uf0b7 If executed in physical copies, obtains the original of the variation document and hands it over to the Legal Department repository for retention purposes; \uf0b7 Uploads executed variation document to SharePoint; \uf0b7 Updates contract record in Salesforce (including financials if changed) and makes additional records in Salesforce as necessary; \uf0b7 Go to Step 15 to continue contract management under CC.PRO.003 - Contract Management process. 14 Terminate Variation Process If a request for variation proves to be not viable, or an agreement on an intended variation cannot be reached, all further negotiations to that effect shall be ceased. GM CM shall inform the requestor of the change accordingly and record the highlights of walkaway position in Salesforce. Note: Shall inability to implement a contract variation present a circumstance of insuperable force for continuation of the Revenue Contract, the situation shall be resolved in accordance with the rights and remedies available under the Revenue Contract. 15 Contract Management Continue to manage amended Revenue Contract in accordance with Contract Management process. 16 End End of Process 8.

Note: *The decision to withdraw needs to take into consideration the conditions of the proposal and associated liabilities (i.e. bid bonds, guarantees, other forms of financial assurance) and has to be adequately documented. 6A Appoint a Negotiating Team GM VP and Director CCM appoint Negotiating Team consisting of GM & Corporate employees as may be required. Negotiating Team reports directly to GM VP and Director CCM. 6B Notify Customer of Intent to Withdraw CCM personnel (or MG BD/Sales) sends notice to customer of intent to withdraw, informs all internal stakeholders, and makes necessary records in Salesforce. Upon completion, go to Step 19. 7 Initiate Amended Financial Analysis As Required If parameters of commercial proposal* (including but not limited to profitability, EBITDA, revenue, CapEx and OpEx assumptions) have materially changed, GM VP initiates amended financial analysis for review at appropriate organizational levels and approval by the authorized officer(s) (as applicable). CCM personnel (or GM BD/Sales) makes appropriate entries in Salesforce to reflect any changes to the original proposal. Note: *In certain circumstances (e.g. negotiating Master Service Agreement (MSA) terms and conditions without making any specific commercial proposals to a customer), this step may not be required. 8 Create Contract Assessment Approval Tool It is recommended that Negotiating Team creates and begins to populate form CC.FOR.002 \u2013 Contract Assessment Approval Tool for the terms and conditions of the contract under consideration early in the process and continues to update it as negotiations progress. IMPORTANT: CC.FOR.002 \u2013 Contract Assessment Approval Tool MUST be completed at the time final draft contract is prepared for reviews and approvals as described in Step 11. 9 Negotiate Terms & Conditions Negotiating Team \u2013 \uf0b7 Negotiates terms, conditions and commercial terms as required; \uf0b7 Involves Support Functions and subject matter experts on as needed basis; \uf0b7 Keeps accurate record of the negotiation process and all agreed changes; \uf0b7 Keeps GM VP, Director CCM and P&L Manager continually informed of the negotiation progress. GM BD/Sales makes appropriate entries in Salesforce as to the progress of negotiations. 10 Acceptable? As negotiations progress, GM VP and Director CCM are briefed by the Negotiating Team and determine if negotiated terms, conditions and commercial terms are acceptable. GM VP (and Negotiating Team as required) will brief Sr. VP of Global Operations to obtain preliminary clearance for acceptance of certain terms, conditions and commercial terms that may require higher level of approval than GM VP. \uf0b7 If YES, go to Step 11 \uf0b7 If NO, go to Step 10A 10A Continue? GM VP determines if contracting process shall continue. \uf0b7 If YES, go to Step 9 \uf0b7 If NO, go to Step 6B 11 Draft Contract Negotiating Team \u2013 Prepares final draft contract once terms and conditions are deemed to have been agreed and acceptable to both parties. At this time, finalization of CC.FOR.002 \u2013 Contract Assessment Approval Tool based on the final draft contract is mandatory. CC.FOR.002 \u2013 Contract Assessment Approval Tool is available in IMS under CCM. Negotiating Team shall complete CC.FOR.002 \u2013 Contract Assessment Approval Tool in accordance with the", "3": "following criteria: Type \u201cA\u201d contracts: Drilling Master Services Agreement (MSA), drilling dayrate contract, O&M contract, Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) contract, rig lease contract, or equivalent contracts. Always Type \u201cB\u201d contracts: Other than type \u201cA\u201d contracts, including, but not limited to: Consulting / engineering services contract, Front End Engineering and Design (FEED), concept development / detail design, offshore barge operations contracts, RAPID service, D3O, or equivalent contracts. If contract value AND risk exposure value exceed $500K 12 Contract Acceptable? GM VP reviews CC.FOR.002 \u2013 Contract Assessment Approval Tool to determine if the contractual terms and conditions are acceptable when and if required, by consulting Director CCM and Sr. VP of Global Operations. Decision is communicated in writing to Negotiating Team, and CCM personnel (or GM BD/Sales) records the decision in Salesforce. \uf0b7 If YES, go to Step 13 \uf0b7 If NO, go to Step 6B 13 Additional Approvals Required? Are Additional Approval(s) Required? To the extent that negotiated terms and conditions of the final draft contract (per the finalized CC.FOR.002 \u2013 Contract Assessment Approval Tool) materially differ from the assumptions that supported the original proposal or result in significant changes to commercial model and/or legal and commercial liability exposure, such terms and conditions shall be reviewed at appropriate organizational levels and approved by the authorized officer(s). \uf0b7 If YES, go to Step 14 \uf0b7 If NO, go to Step 15 14 Additional Approvals Secured? Depending on materiality of the changes as described in Step 13 above, GM VP supported by the members of Negotiating Team as required presents the negotiated draft contract to the authorized officer(s) and requests approval as per applicable Delegation of Authority standard. Authorized officer(s) review the details of the negotiated contract and communicate decision to GM VP. GM VP communicates the decision in writing to Negotiating Team. CCM personnel (or GMBD/Sales) records such decision in Salesforce. \uf0b7 If YES, go to Step 15 \uf0b7 If NO, go to Step 6B 15 Final Contract Review Representatives of CCM and Legal functions jointly perform final review of the draft contract and confirm that its terms and conditions accurately capture the negotiated agreement between the parties. 16 Execute Contract Negotiating Team and authorized approving officer(s) endorse CC.FOR.002 \u2013 Contract Assessment Approval Tool, and PW\u2019s officer (or designee) with a signing authority for contracting entity executes Revenue Contract. Note: For determining authorized PW\u2019s officer with proper signing authority Negotiating Team shall contact Corporate Legal Department. 17 Close Out CCM personnel (or GM BD/Sales, or Designee): \uf0b7 Upload complete set of executed contractual documents to SharePoint. If the final soft and fully signed copies of the Revenue Contract are posted in MS Teams, at this time such documents must be posted in SharePoint and a link shall be included in the contract record in Salesforce; \uf0b7 Obtain the original hardcopy of the Revenue Contract (if executed in physical copies) and hand it over to Legal Department repository; \uf0b7 Create and activate contract entry in Salesforce; \uf0b7 Update the final commercial model (bid sheet) per the negotiated terms; and \uf0b7 Provide a copy of executed contract to P&L Manager and other GM and Divisional Operational and Finance personnel. 18 Contract Handover Negotiating Team organizes and carries out a formal handover of the negotiated and executed Revenue Contract to the P&L Manager and other GM and Divisional Operational personnel. Note: Negotiating Team shall not be required to carry out formal handover of Revenue Contracts for offshore barge operations due to relative brevity of offshore projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and predominant use of PW\u2019s model contract forms, except when a formal contract handover is requested by the P&L Manager (i.e. longer duration drilling campaigns, non-standard contract terms, etc.). This step shall be led by GMBD/Sales and CCM assigned personnel. Handing over shall include the contract overview with identification of main risks, obligations and responsibilities. Aspects to be addressed during the handover shall as a minimum include the following: \uf0b7 Objectives and scope of work \uf0b7 Key contract terms and conditions \uf0b7 Non-standard risks and liabilities \uf0b7 Roles and responsibilities of the parties \uf0b7 Contract deliverables \uf0b7 Timescales and milestones \uf0b7 Interfaces and level of authority \uf0b7 Reporting requirements \uf0b7 Disputes and dispute resolution mechanism \uf0b7 Recourse and penalties \uf0b7 Invoicing and payment terms and provisions General outline of the Contract Handover Presentation (CC.TEM.003) is available in IMS under CCM. Upon conclusion of the contract handover meeting CCM personnel (or GM BD/Sales) make appropriate entry in Salesforce, listing the participants of the meeting and uploading a copy of Contract Handover Presentation to the appropriate folder in SharePoint. Note: Thereafter, P&L Manager responsible for the management of the Revenue Contract may elect to conduct refresher presentations on as needed basis to reinforce understanding of the contractual terms by the Division\u2019s Operational personnel or in the events of significant changes in key Division\u2019s Operational personnel\u2019s positions. 19 End End of Contracting Process 8.

Yevgrafov J. Lochridge Major process overhaul, including the revisions to eliminate obsolete steps and forms; streamline process flow; and update the document to reflect new PW brand.", "4": "1. Purpose: This document outlines the process for New Market Entry (NME). The NME process governs the scope, responsibilities and requirements for conducting due diligence activities in order to determine feasibility of establishing and maintaining operations in support of business opportunities in new markets that are aligned with Parker Wellbore (PW) corporate long-term business development strategy and expansion into new markets, in which PW is not presently operational. 2. Scope: a. This process applies to all Corporate and Geomarket (GM) personnel who are involved in due diligence activities for managing business opportunities in new market environments. b. The NME process applies to all GMs with either international or domestic operations, which consider pursuing business opportunities, which require NME. c. All Corporate and GM personnel shall become familiar with and adhere to this process. d. This process may be considered and utilized in conjunction with BD.PRO.002 \u2013 Opportunity Management and CC.PRO.001 \u2013 Proposal Management process. 3. References: a. BD.PRO.002 \u2013 Opportunity Management b. CC.PRO.001 \u2013 Proposal Management c. FN.STD.002.20 \u2013 Delegation of Authority (DOA) 4. Overview: a. The NME process is designed to support the scope of activities conducted by the GM and Corporate designated personnel in pursuance of business opportunities, which require NME. This includes initial assessment of new markets and business case development, and, if pre-approved by the Executive Leadership Tem (ELT), followed by the fact-gathering, or due diligence work on a new market under consideration, so that the associated business opportunities are holistically assessed and developed, and GM and Corporate personnel have adequate and sufficient data about new market in order to present key findings to the ELT, who will then jointly authorize or otherwise reject authorization for NME. b. The underlying purpose of the NME process is to organize and coordinate fact-gathering work about a specific new market as defined in Section 5 below, including general overview of the market and its competition and pricing, analysis of operating costs, etc. and if this entails establishing a permanent presence in a new country, where PW is not currently operational, then also a comprehensive study of the new country, including collection of key social, political and economic data, i.e. geographical location, political regime, legislation, judicial and fiscal systems, taxation regime, import and export regulations, availability and costing of goods and services, etc. This fact-gathering and investigative activities are collectively referred to as Due Diligence (DD). c. DD is a critical element of NME process intended to provide sufficient proxy data about anticipated market- and country-specific operating conditions and costs in support of business opportunities pursued in the new market environments. In absence of in-house data about such markets or country-specific operating conditions and costs, it allows the GM and ELT to make educated decisions and drives the decision-making process by ensuring proper understanding of social, political and economic risks associated with a NME and preemptively identifying ways to mitigate such risks. 5. Requirements: For the purpose of this process, the term \u201cnew market\u201d may include one or combination of the following: a. New market = new service or product: PW is willing to offer a new, additional service or product in a country with the established presence where PW currently offers certain of its services or products; b. New market = new country of operations: 1,2 PW is willing to enter a new country of operations to offer certain of its services or products (either with or without establishing permanent presence in the new country of operations). Notes: 1 New country of operations can be either (i) a sovereign state or (ii) a region within a sovereign state with largely recognized special administrative status or autonomy (e.g. Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, etc.); 2 New country of operations can be either (i) a new country/region in which PW has never operated historically or (ii) a country/region where PW has not been operational in the past two (2) years or where material economic/political changes have occurred since last operation/DD campaign. Based on the above definitions of new markets, the process and scope of DD activities can be generally organized in the following tiers: Tiers of DD for NME campaigns Tiers Inputs Tier 1 Examples: PW is already established in the country of operations and provides certain services or/and products, but wishes to expand the suite of services/products Tier 2 Examples: Drilling: Project/engineering services, consulting, training, dry lease opportunities, etc.) Rental: Single sales transactions, rentals with no direct operations, etc.) Tier 3 Examples: Drilling: O&M services, drilling services with PW\u2019s rig(s) in country Rental: Machine shop services, TRS, rentals with direct operations, etc.) Current established presence? Yes No No Certain services and products currently offered? Yes No No Want to offer\u2026 An additional service or product (not currently provided) A service or/and product that does not require establishing permanent presence A service or product that requires establishing permanent presence Process & scope of DD activities Pre-DD ELT Opportunity Review Form ELT Opportunity Review Form ELT Opportunity Review Form DD DD Checklist (Questionnaire) \u2013 Section XVI ONLY - Operational considerations and costing info + Partner considerations (as required) Full DD Checklist (Questionnaire) + Partner considerations (as required) + In-country location visit (as required) Full DD Checklist (Questionnaire) + Partner considerations (as required) + In-country location visit (as required) 6.

DD Team members record their findings and update CC.FOR.003 - DD Checklist (Questionnaire) or otherwise report their findings to GM BD/Sales and GM CE personnel to update master copy of the CC.FOR.003 - DD Checklist (Questionnaire), if not stored in a dedicated shared-access site and document repository accessible by all DD Team members. 15 Review & Finalize CC.FOR.003 - DD Checklist (Questionnaire) Upon completion of the CC.FOR.003 - DD Checklist (Questionnaire), GM BD/Sales and GM CCM personnel requests the DD Team members to conduct their final review and validation of information contained therein. DD Team members provide their comments, observations, and updates/edits to the CC.FOR.003 - DD Checklist (Questionnaire). Step No. Step Title Description 16 Partner Considerations (Optional) In the course of DD campaign, GM may be learning that in certain new markets a decision about what type of operating entity should be established may be subject to a number of partner considerations (e.g. government-warranted local partnership requirements, or partnering with a local companies to gain access to the established infrastructure and thus, secure an additional competitive advantage, etc.). If so, such partner considerations should be researched by the members of DD Team, including Operations, Legal/Compliance and Tax, and taken into account in regards to the DD Team\u2019s recommendation on the type of operating entity. 17 Develop ELT DD Findings Summary Presentation GM BD/Sales and GM CCM personnel conduct final interviews with the DD Team members to identify key findings and obtain general recommendation from the perspective of each business function as to whether they recommend NME or not.

The ultimate goal is to ensure that PW Proposals are developed at the highest quality level, are aligned with corporate and GMs\u2019 strategies for achieving sustainable commercial results, assist in positioning PW with emphasis on commitment to deliver innovative, reliable and efficient performance for its customers and increase chances for obtaining new business and retention of existing business. d. The process identifies the ultimate accountability and responsibility for the Proposal Management process steps. Within GMs, management may delegate the responsibilities for completion of individual steps or portions thereof in accordance with existing GM\u2019s organizational and reporting structure and in strict compliance with the applicable Delegation of Authority standard. However, the ultimate accountability and responsibility for completion of those individual steps or portions thereof remains with designated role or an individual in that role or function specified in the process step. 5.

Process Steps: The following table outlines the steps of the Proposal Management process: Step No. Step Title Description 1 Start GM BD receives customer request or finds an opportunity for an unsolicited proposal through awareness of customer project requirements and/or other intelligence; GM BD receives, collects and uploads (or causes to be uploaded) all relevant documents to SharePoint database (refer to Appendix A for electronic filing instructions) and informs CCM personnel about potential new proposal. If the underlying opportunity has not been previously processed and approved, GM BD may be required to complete necessary activities in accordance with BD.PRO.002 \u2013 Opportunity Management process. This includes completion of \u201cKnow Your Customer Form\u201d, if required. 2 Pursue? A decision to either pursue and prepare a proposal or decline participation in the project shall be made in accordance with opportunity approval authority considerations set forth in Section 1 of Appendix B hereto. Approving officer(s) shall communicate this decision in writing (through the workflow in Salesforce or by e-mail). GM BD shall appropriately record the decision in the Salesforce. \uf0b7 If YES, go to Step 3 \uf0b7 If NO, go to Step 2A 2A Notify customer & Decline GM BD or CCM personnel, who is assigned as a focal point for communications with customer, sends a decline notice or otherwise notifies customer of intention not to submit a proposal, informs all internal stakeholders, makes necessary records in Salesforce and ensures related documents are posted in SharePoint database. 3 Send Notice of Intent to Customer If the decision is to prepare a proposal, GM BD or CCM personnel, who is assigned as a focal point for communications with customer, sends a Notice of Intent to customer, informs all internal stakeholders, makes necessary records in Salesforce and posts such Notice of Intent in SharePoint database. 4 Assemble Proposal Team GM BD, GM VP, and CCM Personnel work together to establish Proposal Team. Proposal Team typically consists of GM Operations, GM BD, CCM personnel, GM Finance Manager, Operations Finance, Technical Services personnel as needed. For unsolicited proposals this complement may be reduced, however it shall always include CCM personnel. In addition, a single point of contact is nominated for customer communications (usually GM BD or CCM Personnel). This contact obtains clarifications from customer as required and distributes responses to all members of the Proposal Team and other internal stakeholders as may be required. Proposal Team is encouraged to use MS Teams as much as possible as a collaborative space for contract reviews (redlines), working on the documents, spreadsheets, etc. which require input from multiple Support Functions; provided that the final submission package of the Proposal and the commercial model (bid sheet) are posted in SharePoint as set forth in Step 15. 5 Review Project Requirements or Tender Documents. Clarifications Proposal Team reviews customer project specific requirements or tender documents If any customer project specific requirements or tender requirements are unclear and/or require clarification, all clarification requests shall be collected and communicated to the customer by the designated point of contact. If customer\u2019s tender documents establish clarification process protocol, such protocol shall be adhered to at all times. Similarly, customer\u2019s responses to clarification requests shall be disseminated to the Proposal Team by the designated point of contact and posted on SharePoint. 6 Summarize Requirements & Develop Accountability Matrix (CC.FOR.001) Based on review of customer\u2019s project specific requirements or tender documentation, CCM personnel jointly with GM BD summarizes the requirements and develops Accountability Matrix as per form CC.FOR.001 with individual assignment of relevant sections, expected deliverables/feedback and due dates to members of Proposal Team and other functional area departments. Preparation of Accountability Matrix for unsolicited and direct negotiation Proposals is recommended as a good business practice. Unsolicited Proposals: In the absence of a formal request from a customer, GM BD is responsible to: a) ensure that Proposal Team has relevant and sufficient customer project requirements to enable the Proposal preparation; b) timely and fully inform Proposal Team of all the pertinent developments related to the project and proposal preparation; and c) ensure that CCM personnel are always involved in unsolicited proposal preparation process. 7 Distribute Documents & Perform Credit Check (if required) CCM personnel distribute the documents alongside with CC.FOR.001 Accountability Matrix to Proposal Team and relevant Support Functions. Such Support Functions shall include: \uf02d Support Function personnel assigned to GM, as applicable \uf02d CCM \uf02d Legal (also serves as interface with Compliance) \uf02d Risk Management, Tax and Treasury \uf02d Operations Integrity and Sustainability \uf02d Technical Services \uf02d Operations Support, and - Other functions as deemed necessary (HR, Asset Management, SCM, Maintenance, etc.). Distribution of the documents may be accompanied by a kick-off meeting with participation of Proposal Team and Support", "8": "Functions. Please refer to CC.TEM.001 - Kick-off Meeting Presentation Template. Although a formal kick-off meeting and the use of the presentation template is encouraged, it is optional. At this stage of the process, CCM personnel requests Corporate Treasury group to perform a credit check on any new customer or an existing customer (if there is reasonable assumption that its financial position might have weakened) and reflect the results in the relevant Proposal\u2019s file in SharePoint. 8 Consolidate Input CCM personnel collect, upload, update, generally maintain, and complete set of documentation related to a Proposal under consideration, including pertinent tender documents or important project details, final version of the commercial model (bid sheet), records of internal reviews and work documents in the SharePoint database as per existing procedures (refer to Appendix A for electronic filing instructions.) 9 Prepare Proposal Submittal Package Ref. Appendix C, Proposal Deliverables Proposal Team prepares Proposal submittal package, that typically includes inputs on the following: \uf02d Definitions of requirements (including Scope of Work and Responsibilities) \u2013 GM Operations; \uf02d Contractual terms and conditions (commercial and legal) \u2013 CCM and Legal personnel; \uf02d Commercial rate structure \u2013 CCM personnel in cooperation with GM BD / Sales, Corporate FPA and other Support Functions, as may be required, suggests preferable commercial rate structure; \uf02d Equipment specifications \u2013 GM Operations, and \uf02d Commercial model (bid sheet) \u2013 GM Finance, Corporate FPA, CCM personnel and GM BD / Sales. For the general outline of the Proposal\u2019s structure, please refer to Appendix C Proposal Deliverables suggesting sections that shall comprise the Proposal in case customer is not prescribing the submission content. Appendix C Proposal Deliverables also recommends some documents that may be included to emphasize the value proposition of the Proposal. In collaboration with P&L Manager and CCM personnel, GM BD develops and forwards salient points of recommended Proposal to the GM VP for review and makes available other elements of submittal package if required by GM VP. GM BD records such salient points and recommendations in Salesforce. 10 Establish Dates for Proposal Reviews as Required Every commercial Proposal, prepared either through a formal tender process or direct negotiation, MUST be reviewed at appropriate organizational levels and approved by the authorized officer(s). There may be multiple tiers of Proposal reviews and approvals required depending on the criteria set forth in Section 2 of Appendix B, including: \uf0b7 Peer Review (either Internal GM \u2019s Review or Extended Peer Review), and/or \uf0b7 ELT Review, and/or \uf0b7 Board of Directors\u2019 (BOD) Review. GM BD advises GM VP of the requirements for Peer Review and/or ELT Review and proposes the dates consistent with Steps 11 and 12 of the Process. If a BOD Review is required, GM VP shall defer to the COO and CEO to determine participants, their availability, date and format of the BOD Review meeting. Lists of mandatory and recommended/optional participants for each tier of Proposal reviews are provided in Section 2 of Appendix B. 11 Conduct Peer Review 1 [No later than 7-5 days prior to submission] GM BD is responsible for organizing and scheduling Peer Review and ensuring all participants are timely notified. \uf0b7 Under normal circumstances Peer Review, either Internal GM\u2019s Review or Extended Peer Review, shall be held no later than 7-5 business days prior to the date of Proposal submission (or Proposal dispatch date as may be applicable). \uf0b7 GM BD / Sales prepares Peer Review Presentation in accordance with the standards for the content as set forth in the Peer Review Presentation Template.

APPENDIX C \u2013 PROPOSAL DELIVERABLES, DRILLING SERVICES Parker Drilling Proposals structure may vary depending on customer\u2019s requirements but shall be ultimately tailored to suit customer\u2019s needs and instructions as prescribed in the Invitation to Tender (ITT), Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), Pre-Qualification (PQF), Solicitations of Interest (SOI), Expression of Interest (RFI), and Inquiry (INQ) etc. Typically, a Proposal would feature the following components: a. Technical, collectively referring to any information describing scope of work/services GM is offering to deliver; any drilling rigs and/or rental equipment that will be used to deliver services (i.e. equipment inventory and technical specifications); allocation of responsibilities between contacting parties (aka. \u2018Matrix of Responsibilities\u2019); startup/mobilization schedules and logistics; manpower, etc. b. Contractual, collectively referring to contractual terms and conditions, which would lay out framework for future transaction. In absence of customer\u2019s draft contract with customer preferred contractual terms and conditions) and given that customer has requested so, Proposal Team will work to prepare an appropriate draft contract model based on standard forms of contracts with Parker\u2019s preferred terms and conditions available with Corporate CCM group (e.g. International Dayrate Drilling Contract, O&M Master Drilling Contract, Lease Agreement or Master Drilling Agreement \u2013 select as appropriate in: https://insideparker.parkerdrilling.com/depts/bd/Shared%20Documents/Forms/All%20Documents%20BD.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fdepts%2Fbd%2FShared%20Documents%2FTechnical%20Library%20%2D%20Resources%2FContract%20Forms&FolderCTID=0x012000BA0820B3D9D26F4E961ABC6E470DB77A&View=%7B73159DCF%2D4EEF%2D47DD%2D9F1A%2D37DB1F576D75%7D Generally, for solicited Proposals, customers include draft contract in the tender documents when a tender is released. If a draft contract has been included, members of Proposal Team are required to review it in accordance with the internal guidelines and practices for contracting. It is imperative that CCM and Legal/Compliance at both Corporate and GM\u2019s levels perform a comprehensive review of the entire draft contract to the extent practicable. Although a comprehensive review of the draft contract by other Support Functions on Proposal Team is recommended, their review may still be limited to that of relevant sections only, either within the main body of the contract or attachments/exhibits (e.g. Operations need to review and provide their observations with regard to the scope of work/services, allocation of responsibilities between contracting parties, Operations Integrity and Sustainability to review HSE and/or Quality pertinent sections, Risk Management to review insurance requirements, etc.) c. Commercial, collectively referring to any pricing information, including \u2013 for example - daily rates, lump sum fees and other charges (e.g. equipment rental rates, call-out rates for specialized manpower, etc.). All commercials shall be based on the commercial model (aka. \u2018Bid Sheet\u2019) and shall be easily decipherable (calculable, or formula-based, and not hard-keyed). Developing and maintaining an up-to-date version of bid model at all times is central to preparation of any commercial Proposal. This process starts immediately after tender documents or project specific requirements are distributed to Proposal Team and continues as the Proposal is being developed. The parties responsible for commercial model preparation shall keep CCM personnel appraised of their work to ensure the alignment of the commercial model to contractual redlines and structure."}
