Contract Management process outlined here shall be utilized by the Contracts and Commercial Management (CCM) personnel and other Corporate and GeoMarket (GM) Support Functions personnel involved in contract management, including drafting, preparing, reviewing, negotiating and approving relevant variation documents of Revenue Contracts. b. For the purpose of this process, the term \u201cvariation documents\u201d shall be used generically to describe the entire nomenclature of documents to introduce changes to the terms and conditions previously agreed and documented by the contracting parties. Thus, the term \u201cvariation documents\u201d shall collectively include any amendments, addenda, change orders, modifications, revisions, and the like, to the existing Revenue Contracts. c. The process\u2019s goal is to provide a standard approach to managing and amending Revenue Contracts as may be required due to operational needs during contract life cycle. d. Adherence to the process ensures the following: - Systemized approach in managing executed Revenue Contracts by GM\u2019s Operations through minimizing the exposure to commercial and legal risks and preventing value leakage; - Adequate understanding of the contractual terms and conditions by individuals responsible for contract performance; - Compliance with contractual terms and conditions in the course of contract performance; - Identification of needs for change and timely engagement with various internal functions and customer throughout the change process; and - Handling and resolution of claims and disputes arising in the course of contract performance. e. The ultimate goals of this process are to ensure that: - Company\u2019s inventory of revenue contracts is managed in accordance with company accepted practices; - GMs\u2019 operational performance is in line with contractual requirements; - Customer\u2019s expectations are continuously met or exceeded to allow PW either retain or expand its business; - Profitability is maintained at the levels projected during the price formulation and value deterioration is avoided; - Emerging needs for change are promptly identified and managed to accommodate new requirements evolving during contract performance; and - Value to PW is maximized through effective and efficient management of existing inventory of Revenue Contracts. 6.

Contract Management Process Flow: a. []Process Map: The following illustration provides the basic flow for the Contract Management process: b. Process Steps: The following table outlines the steps of the Contract Management process: +-------+------------------+------------------------------------------+ | | Step Title | Description | | Step | | | | No. | | | +=======+==================+==========================================+ | 1 | Start | Pursuant to CC.PRO.002 Contracting- | | | | Drilling & Well Services process, P&L | | | (Contract | Manager and other GM and Divisional | | | Handover) | Operational and Finance personnel | | | | participate in a formal contract | | | | handover meeting conducted by the | | | | Negotiating Team. | | | | | | | | Note: CCM personnel or GM CM create a | | | | contract record in Salesforce for the | | | | new Revenue Contract. | | | | | | | | In addition GM CM, or individual | | | | assigned this responsibility, may | | | | develop a contract briefing document | | | | that summarizes essentials of the | | | | Revenue Contract, key contract | | | | clauses, responsibilities and | | | | obligations of the parties. | | | | | | | | Such contract briefing document may | | | | include actions and rationale behind | | | | some non-standard clauses, specific | | | | requirements, clarification of certain | | | | aspects of | +-------+------------------+------------------------------------------+ +-------+------------------+------------------------------------------+ | | | contract or project, layouts of the | | | | processes describing how changes will | | | | be managed and disputes will be | | | | handled and resolved. | | | | | | | | Although development of contract | | | | briefing document as a quick reference | | | | guide is a good contract management | | | | practice, this is an optional | | | | activity. | +=======+==================+==========================================+ | | | As may be required, a joint contract | | | | kick-off meeting shall take place at | | | | the outset of operations under the new | | | | Revenue Contract engaging the | | | | participants from customer\u2019s | | | | organization. Typically, these | | | | meetings are warranted by customers, | | | | but are generally considered to be a | | | | good contract and commercial | | | | management practice. | +-------+------------------+------------------------------------------+ | 2 | Joint Contract | A joint contract kick-off meeting will | | | Kick-Off | feature discussion of the same | | | Meeting with | contractual highlights, which are | | | Customer | covered during the internal handover | | | (Optional) | of contract from the Negotiating team | | | | to GM\u2019s Divisional Operational | | | | personnel, and engage personnel from | | | | both sides who had been actively | | | | involved in negotiation of the | | | | contract and going forward will be | | | | primarily responsible for its | | | | performance. | +-------+------------------+------------------------------------------+ | | | Joint contract kick-off meetings may | | | | be helpful from the perspective of | | | | achieving better alignment with | | | | customer\u2019s expectations and obtaining | | | | an understanding of customer\u2019s | | | | priorities during the contract | | | | performance. | +-------+------------------+------------------------------------------+ | | | If kick-off meeting takes place, notes | | | | capturing salient points of the | | | | meeting shall be prepared and posted | | | | in SharePoint and Salesforce. | +-------+------------------+------------------------------------------+ | | | Note: Joint contract kick-off meetings | | | | are advisable, but are not mandatory. | +-------+------------------+------------------------------------------+ +-------+------------------+------------------------------------------+ | 3 | Contract Life | Both GM P&L Manager and GM CM shall | | | Cycle | continuously interact in any and all | | | Management | contract management tasks and | | | | activities. | | | | | | | | As P&L Manager is ultimately | | | | responsible for operational | | | | performance and financial results | | | | under a specific contract, he/she is | | | | formally responsible for day-to-day | | | | management of the Revenue Contract | | | | assigned to him/her. | | | | | | | | GM CM shall act as a primary | | | | facilitator for the contract | | | | management process and provide an | | | | oversight of all contractual matters | | | | related to a specific Revenue | | | | Contract. GM CM interfaces with: | | | | | | | | - Internal stakeholders on all issues | | | | pertinent to the Revenue Contract. | | | | | | | | - His/her counterparts within the | | | | customer\u2019s organization on matters | | | | related to the contract management | | | | and contract variation. | | | | | | | | Day-to-day management of the Revenue | | | | Contract includes working with | | | | internal stakeholders on | | | | clarifications they may have with | | | | regard to application or | | | | interpretation of certain contractual |", "1": "| | | terms, provisions or deliverables | | | | pertinent to their functions, timely | | | | preparation of reports required under | | | | such Revenue Contract, addressing any | | | | developing issues and disputes, | | | | including disputed invoices, etc. | | | | | | | | Note: Activities associated with | | | | contract management are often diverse, | | | | but would typically include activities | | | | described in Steps 3A through 3D | | | | below. | | | | | | | | Additionally, Steps 3A, 3B and 3C may | | | | not necessarily be present in every | | | | contract, or happen in sequence | | | | provided in this document. Step 3D is | | | | always present and follows the others. | +=======+==================+==========================================+ | 3A | Dispute | Any disputes with customer that may | | | Resolution | arise in the course of performance of | | | | the Revenue Contract shall be resolved | | | | in accordance with protocol set out in | | | | corresponding provisions of the | | | | contract applicable to dispute | | | | resolution.

Conversely, | | | | any invoice issues have to be cleared | | | | or escalated to the attention of | | | | appropriate PW\u2019s officer in accordance | | | | with GM\u2019s divisional organization | | | | structure before the contract | | | | close-out. | | | | | | | | All surviving contract obligations | | | | (confidentiality, warranty, etc.) | | | | shall be completed and accounted for. | +-------+------------------+------------------------------------------+ | 4 | Post-Contract | Upon completion of the Revenue | | | Customer | Contract, either due to termination or | | | Review & | upon expiry of the contract term, GM | | | Lessons | BD/Sales shall conduct a formal | | | Learned | close-out interview with customer to | | | | obtain customer\u2019s feedback on | | | | contract/project experience. Salient | | | | points of customer\u2019s feedback or | | | | minutes of meeting, if a formal exit | | | | meeting is held, shall be posted in | | | | Salesforce and SharePoint. | | | | | | | | Additionally GM CM and GM BD/Sales | | | | shall develop a summary of lessons | | | | learned from the contract performance | | | | and publish it in SharePoint. | +-------+------------------+------------------------------------------+ | 5 | End | End of Process | +-------+------------------+------------------------------------------+ 7.

The process outlined here applies to all PW Global GeoMarkets Operations, both international and domestic excluding subordinate organization, Quail Tools. Exclusion may also apply to local ad-hoc or purchase order based agreements. c. GeoMarket global operations maintaining their local standards or procedures shall ensure such local standards or procedures are not in conflict with this process. d. All PW entities, except to the extent excluded in (b) above, shall become familiar with and adhere to this process. e. This process shall be considered and utilized in conjunction with BD.PRO.002 \u2013 Opportunity Management, CC.PRO.001 \u2013 Proposal Management and CC.PRO.003 \u2013 Contract Management processes. 3.

The Contracting process shall be utilized by the Contracts and Commercial Management (CCM) personnel and other Corporate and GeoMarket (GM) Support Functions personnel involved in drafting, preparing, reviewing, negotiating and approving Revenue Contracts. b. The process provides standard approach for developing, negotiating and approving Revenue Contracts. Adherence to the process ensures: proper involvement of the various company Support Functions in reviews and negotiations; transparency and traceability of decision making and approval process; proper transfer of the Revenue Contracts from negotiation phase into operations. The ultimate goals of this process are: - To ensure that company\u2019s inventory of Revenue Contracts is aligned with corporate and GM\u2019s strategies; - To assist GMs in reducing legal, operational and commercial risk exposure; - To improve the profitability of business and deliver value to all PW stakeholders. c. The process identifies the ultimate accountability and responsibility for the Contracting process steps. Within GMs, management may delegate the responsibilities for completion of individual steps or portions thereof in accordance with existing GM\u2019s organizational and reporting structure and in strict compliance with the applicable Delegation of Authority standard; provided, however, that ultimate accountability and responsibility for completion of those individual steps or related portions remains with designated role specified in the process step. 6. Roles & Responsibilities: In recognition of potential differences that may exist in the organizational structure at specific PW locations, roles and responsibilities for the specific process steps may vary; however, the sequence of steps and scope of responsibilities shall not be altered. +------------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | Role | Responsibility | +==================+===================================================+ | Executive | As required: | | Leadership | | | Team (ELT) | - Reviews negotiated Revenue Contract presented | | | by GM and provides recommendations; | | | | | | - Provides approval (or otherwise) for entering | | | into a Revenue Contract. | +------------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | Chief | As required: | | Operating | | | Officer (COO) | - Reviews negotiated Revenue Contract presented | | | by GMs and provides recommendations; | | | | | | - Provides approval (or otherwise) for entering | | | into a Revenue Contract. | +------------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | Geomarket Vice | - Makes decision on entering into negotiations; | | President (GM | | | VP) | - Together with Director CCM appoints the | | | Negotiating Team; | | | | | | - Reviews CC.FOR.002 \u2013 Contract Assessment | | | Approval Tool and provides guidance on risk | | | tolerance; | | | | | | - Provides approval (or otherwise) for entering | | | into a Revenue Contract. | +------------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | Director | - Acts as the owner of Contracting process and | | Contracts and | PW\u2019s established guidelines for | | Commercial | contracting; | | Management | | | (Director | - Provides overall supervision, guidance and | | CCM), or | support throughout the process; | | designee | | | | - Together with GM VP appoints Negotiating | | | Team; | | | | | | - As negotiations progress, together with GM VP | | | determines if negotiated terms, conditions | | | and commercial terms are acceptable. | +------------------+---------------------------------------------------+ +------------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | Contracts and | - Communicate with the customer on Letter of | | Commercial | Intent / Award and throughout Contracting | | Management | process; | | assigned | | | personnel (CCM | - Coordinate the work of Negotiation Team; | | personnel) | | | | - Update records in Salesforce; | | | | | | - Create contract entry in Salesforce; | | | | | | - Organize and carry out the formal transfer of | | | new Revenue Contract from Negotiating Team | | | to GM & Division Operations. | +==================+===================================================+ | GeoMarket | - Works with CCM personnel throughout the | | Business | process and is responsible for timely and | | Development | accurately communicating any developments | | Director / | and progress during Contracting; | | Manager, | | | Product Line / | - Liaise with the customer throughout | | Operations | Contracting process. | | Manager, Sales | | | Representative | | | (GM BD/Sales) | | | 1 | | +------------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | Negotiating | - Assesses the need for revision of commercial | | Team 2 | terms; | | | | | | - Conducts negotiations with customer, | | | maintains negotiation records and keeps GM | | | VP updated on the progress; | | | | | | - Involves Support Functions on as needed | | | basis; | | | | | | - Uploads contract files into SharePoint and | | | updates them as needed; | | | | | | - Creates and updates CC.FOR.002 \u2013 Contract | | | Assessment Approval Tool (led jointly by | | | CCM and Legal Functions); | | | | | | - Prepares final negotiated contract document; | | | | | | - Updates final bid sheet per the final | | | negotiated terms. | +------------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | Functional | - Provide inputs, support and information | | Area | required for contract negotiation; | | Departments | | | (Support | - Review related sections of the contract as | | Functions) | requested by Negotiating Team and provide | | | recommendations; | | | | | | - Conduct final contract review (led jointly by | | | CCM and Legal Functions). | +------------------+---------------------------------------------------+ | Profit & Loss | - Collaborates with CCM personnel and GM | | Manager (P&L | BD/Sales throughout the Contracting | | Manager) 3 | process. | | | | | | - Allocates resources within an organizational | | | division of the GM as required to provide | | | necessary inputs, support and information | | | during Contracting process. | +------------------+---------------------------------------------------+ Notes: 1 In absence of dedicated GM BD/Sales, GM shall designate a person within the GM\u2019s organizational structure responsible for performance of relevant duties and responsibilities.

Purpose: This document outlines the process for New Market Entry (NME). The NME process governs the scope, responsibilities and requirements for conducting due diligence activities in order to determine feasibility of establishing and maintaining operations in support of business opportunities in new markets that are aligned with Parker Wellbore (PW) corporate long- term business development strategy and expansion into new markets, in which PW is not presently operational. 2. Scope: a. This process applies to all Corporate and Geomarket (GM) personnel who are involved in due diligence activities for managing business opportunities in new market environments. b. The NME process applies to all GMs with either international or domestic operations, which consider pursuing business opportunities, which require NME. c. All Corporate and GM personnel shall become familiar with and adhere to this process. d. This process may be considered and utilized in conjunction with BD.PRO.002 \u2013 Opportunity Management and CC.PRO.001 \u2013 Proposal Management process. 3. References: a. BD.PRO.002 \u2013 Opportunity Management b. CC.PRO.001 \u2013 Proposal Management c. FN.STD.002.20 \u2013 Delegation of Authority (DOA) 4. Overview: a. The NME process is designed to support the scope of activities conducted by the GM and Corporate designated personnel in pursuance of business opportunities, which require NME. This includes initial assessment of new markets and business case development, and, if pre-approved by the Executive Leadership Tem (ELT), followed by the fact-gathering, or due diligence work on a new market under consideration, so that the associated business opportunities are holistically assessed and developed, and GM and Corporate personnel have adequate and sufficient data about new market in order to present key findings to the ELT, who will then jointly authorize or otherwise reject authorization for NME. b. The underlying purpose of the NME process is to organize and coordinate fact-gathering work about a specific new market as defined in Section 5 below, including general overview of the market and its competition and pricing, analysis of operating costs, etc. and if this entails establishing a permanent presence in a new country, where PW is not currently operational, then also a comprehensive study of the new country, including collection of key social, political and economic data, i.e. geographical location, political regime, legislation, judicial and fiscal systems, PW \u2013 INTERNAL USE UNCONTROLLED IF PRINTED taxation regime, import and export regulations, availability and costing of goods and services, etc. This fact-gathering and investigative activities are collectively referred to as Due Diligence (DD). c. DD is a critical element of NME process intended to provide sufficient proxy data about anticipated market- and country-specific operating conditions and costs in support of business opportunities pursued in the new market environments. In absence of in-house data about such markets or country-specific operating conditions and costs, it allows the GM and ELT to make educated decisions and drives the decision-making process by ensuring proper understanding of social, political and economic risks associated with a NME and preemptively identifying ways to mitigate such risks. 5. Requirements: For the purpose of this process, the term \u201cnew market\u201d may include one or combination of the following: a. New market = new service or product: PW is willing to offer a new, additional service or product in a country with the established presence where PW currently offers certain of its services or products; b. New market = new country of operations: ^(1,2) PW is willing to enter a new country of operations to offer certain of its services or products (either with or without establishing permanent presence in the new country of operations). Notes: 1 New country of operations can be either (i) a sovereign state or (ii) a region within a sovereign state with largely recognized special administrative status or autonomy (e.g. Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, etc.); 2 New country of operations can be either (i) a new country/region in which PW has never operated historically or (ii) a country/region where PW has not been operational in the past two (2) years or where material economic/political changes have occurred since last operation/DD campaign. Based on the above definitions of new markets, the process and scope of DD activities can be generally organized in the following tiers: +------------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | Tiers of DD | | | | | for NME | | | | | campaigns | | | | +==================+================+================+=================+ | Tiers | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | | | | | | | Inputs | Examples: | Examples: | Examples: | | | | | | | | PW is | Drilling: | Drilling: O&M | | | already | Proje | services, | | | established | ct/engineering | drilling | | | in the | services, | services with | | | country of | consulting, | PW\u2019s rig(s) | | | operations | training, | in country | | | and provides | dry lease | | | | certain | | Rental: | | | services | opportunities, | Machine shop | | | or/and | etc.) | services, | | | products, | | TRS, rentals | | | but wishes | Rental: | with direct | | | to expand | Single sales | operations, | | | the suite of | | etc.) | | | ser | transactions, | | | | vices/products | rentals with | | | | | no direct | | | | | operations, | | | | | etc.) | | +------------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | Current | Yes | No | No | | established | | | | | presence? | | | | +------------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | Certain | Yes | No | No | | services and | | | | | products | | | | | currently | | | | | offered? | | | | +------------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ +-------+---------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | | | An | A service | A service or | | Want | | additional | or/and | product that | | to | | service or | product that | requires | | o | | product (not | does not | establishing | | ffer\u2026 | | currently | require | permanent | | | | provided) | establishing | presence | | | | | permanent | | | | | | presence | | +=======+=========+================+================+=================+ | | | ELT | ELT | ELT | | | | Opportunity | Opportunity | Opportunity | | | | Review | | Review | +-------+---------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | | | Form | Review Form | Form | | | Pre-DD | | | | +-------+---------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | Pr | | DD Checklist | Full DD | Full DD | | ocess | | | Checklist | Checklist | | & | | | | | +-------+---------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | | | ( | ( | | | scope | | Questionnaire) | Questionnaire) | (Questionnaire) | | of | | \u2013 | | | +-------+---------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | DD | | Section XVI | + | + | | | | ONLY - | | | +-------+---------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | | DD | Operational | Partner | Partner | | activ | | | | | | ities | | considerations | considerations | considerations | | | | and | (as | (as required) | | | | | required) | | +-------+---------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | | | costing info | + | + | +-------+---------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | | | + | In-country | In-country | | | | | location | location | | | | | visit | visit | +-------+---------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | | | Partner | (as | (as required) | | | | | required) | | | | | considerations | | | +-------+---------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ | | | (as | | | | | | required) | | | +-------+---------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+ 6.

Purpose: This document outlines the process of Proposal Management. The process governs activities related to development and management of proposals for Parker Wellbore (PW) operations, prepared by PW for external customers (hereinafter referred to as \u201cProposals\u201d). 2. Scope: a. This document applies to all Corporate and GeoMarket (GM) personnel who are or potentially may be involved in preparing, reviewing, and approving Proposals (both solicited and unsolicited). b. The Proposal Management process applies to all GMs of both international and domestic operations except for Quail Tools, Well Construction, Well Intervention and Surface & Tubular service lines. For the sake of clarity, the process applies to all Owned Drilling, Dry Lease, O&M and rig related opportunities c. This process shall be considered and utilized in conjunction with BD.PRO.002 \u2013 Opportunity Management and CC.PRO.002 \u2013 Contracting processes. 3. References: a.

LG.REF.001 \u2013 Contracts & Tender Responsibilities Matrix - PARIS 4. Overview: a. Proposals defined in this process include: 1. Solicited Proposals (Invitation to Tender (ITT), Request for Proposal (RFP), and Request for Quotation (RFQ), Pre-Qualification (PQF), Solicitations of Interest (SOI), Expression of Interest (EOI), and Inquiry (INQ), etc.) (provided however, that PQFs, SOIs, EOIs, etc. NOT requiring commercial proposal or binding commitment from PW, shall not be subject to the reviews and approvals required in accordance with Steps 10 through 14 of this Process) 2. Unsolicited / Direct Negotiation Proposals. b. The Contracts and Commercial Management Department (CCM) personnel, GM personnel and other Support Functions involved in the preparation of Proposals, for existing or potential customers shall utilize Proposal Management process outlined here. c. The process is developed with the goal of providing a standard approach for preparing Proposals to customers. Adherence to the process ensures proper involvement of the various PW functions in reviews and development of Proposals; transparency and traceability of decision making and approval process; completeness of the document package and accuracy of the records. The ultimate goal is to ensure that PW Proposals are developed at the highest quality level, are aligned with corporate and GMs\u2019 strategies for achieving sustainable commercial results, assist in positioning PW with emphasis on commitment to deliver innovative, reliable and efficient performance for its customers and increase chances for obtaining new business and retention of existing business. d. The process identifies the ultimate accountability and responsibility for the Proposal Management process steps. Within GMs, management may delegate the responsibilities for completion of individual steps or portions thereof in accordance with existing GM\u2019s organizational and reporting structure and in strict compliance with the applicable Delegation of Authority standard. However, the ultimate accountability and responsibility for completion of those individual steps or portions thereof remains with designated role or an individual in that role or function specified in the process step. 5.

Given that multiple levels of approval may be required for an individual opportunity, GM\u2019s decision to pursue opportunity shall be reviewed and approved by the authorized officer(s) with the highest level of authority required. Section 2 \u2013 Proposal Review and Approval Tiers Every Proposal MUST be reviewed at appropriate organizational levels and approved by the authorized officer(s) before such Proposal can be delivered to the customer. Criteria used to determine what tiers of Proposal review and approval may be required are similar to the ones used to determine whether an opportunity shall be pursued by the GM. In order to determine whether a Proposal requires an Internal GM Review, an Extended Peer Review or higher levels of review and approval (ELT Review and BOD Review), please refer to the table below. +---------+--------------------+--------+---------+---------+--------+ | L | Approval to | GM | Sr. | Chief | | | evel(s) | Prepare Proposal | VP | VP of | Ex | Board | | of | | | | ecutive | of | | A | Approval of | | Global | | Dir | | pproval | Final Proposal | | Ope | Officer | ectors | | Au | | | rations | (CEO) | | | thority | | | (COO) | | (BOD) | | R | | | | | | | equired | | | | | | | | | | | | | | (Aut | | | | | | | horized | | | | | | | Of | | | | | | | ficers) | | | | | | +=========+====================+========+=========+=========+========+ | Tiers | | In | E | ELT | BOD | | of | | ternal | xtended | | | | P | | GM | Peer | | | | roposal | | | | Review | Review | | | | | Review | | | | Review | | Review | | | | | R | | | | | | | equired | | | | | | +---------+--------------------+--------+---------+---------+--------+ | Asset | (A) Asset | X | | | | | Rel | remains or new | | | | | | ocation | service is | | | | | | and | offered within | | | | | | New | the same country | | | | | | | | | | | | | Market | | | | | | | Entry | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Conside | | | | | | | rations | | | | | | +---------+--------------------+--------+---------+---------+--------+ | | (B) Asset moves | X | | | | | | to or new | | | | | | | service is | | | | | | | offered in a | | | | | | | country with the | | | | | | | established | | | | | | | presence within | | | | | | | the same | | | | | | | | | | | | | | GM | | | | | +---------+--------------------+--------+---------+---------+--------+ | | (C) Asset moves | | X | X | | | | to a country in | | | | | | | a different GM | | | | | +---------+--------------------+--------+---------+---------+--------+ | | (D) Asset moves | | X | X | X | | | to or new | | | | | | | service is | | | | | | | offered in a new | | | | | | | country with no | | | | | | | established | | | | | | | | | | | | | | presence | | | | | +---------+--------------------+--------+---------+---------+--------+ | | (E) Pursued | | X | X | X | | | opportunity | | | | | | | would ultimately | | | | | | | require | | | | | | | establishing | | | | | | | permanent | | | | | | | presence in a | | | | | | | new country | | | | | +---------+--------------------+--------+---------+---------+--------+ | | (F) CapEx within | X | | | | | Project | the approved | | | | | | Es | budget for GM | | | | | | timated | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Capital | | | | | | | Expe | | | | | | | nditure | | | | | | +---------+--------------------+--------+---------+---------+--------+ | | (G) CapEx within | | X | X | | | | the approved | | | | | | | budget for the | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Drilling | | | | | | | organization | | | | | +---------+--------------------+--------+---------+---------+--------+ | | (H) CapEx above | | X | X | | | | the approved | | | | | | | budget for GM up | | | | | | | to $2MM | | | | | +---------+--------------------+--------+---------+---------+--------+ | | (I) Any CapEx | | X | X | X | | | over $2MM | | | | | +---------+--------------------+--------+---------+---------+--------+ Section 3 \u2013 Recommended Review Participation by Tiers The table below contains the guidelines for determining required quorum of participants for each tier of Proposal review as optional attendees: +---------+--------------------------+--------------------------------+ | | Mandatory Participants | Recommended/Optional | | | | Participants | +=========+==========================+================================+ | I | - GM Personnel, | - Other GM personnel (at the | | nternal | including: | discretion of GM | | GM | | Regional BD;

Technical, collectively referring to any information describing scope of work/services GM is offering to deliver; any drilling rigs and/or rental equipment that will be used to deliver services (i.e. equipment inventory and technical specifications); allocation of responsibilities between contacting parties (aka. \u2018Matrix of Responsibilities\u2019); startup/mobilization schedules and logistics; manpower, etc. b. Contractual, collectively referring to contractual terms and conditions, which would lay out framework for future transaction. In absence of customer\u2019s draft contract with customer preferred contractual terms and conditions) and given that customer has requested so, Proposal Team will work to prepare an appropriate draft contract model based on standard forms of contracts with Parker\u2019s preferred terms and conditions available with Corporate CCM group (e.g. International Dayrate Drilling Contract, O&M Master Drilling Contract, Lease Agreement or Master Drilling Agreement \u2013 select as appropriate in: https://insideparker.parkerdrilling.com/depts/bd/Shared%20Documents/Forms/All%20Documents%20BD. aspx?RootFolder=%2Fdepts%2Fbd%2FShared%20Documents%2FTechnical%20Library%20%2D%20R esources%2FContract%20Forms&FolderCTID=0x012000BA0820B3D9D26F4E961ABC6E470DB77A&Vi ew=%7B73159DCF%2D4EEF%2D47DD%2D9F1A%2D37DB1F576D75%7D Generally, for solicited Proposals, customers include draft contract in the tender documents when a tender is released. If a draft contract has been included, members of Proposal Team are required to review it in accordance with the internal guidelines and practices for contracting. It is imperative that CCM and Legal/Compliance at both Corporate and GM\u2019s levels perform a comprehensive review of the entire draft contract to the extent practicable. Although a comprehensive review of the draft contract by other Support Functions on Proposal Team is recommended, their review may still be limited to that of relevant sections only, either within the main body of the contract or attachments/exhibits (e.g. Operations need to review and provide their observations with regard to the scope of work/services, allocation of responsibilities between contracting parties, Operations Integrity and Sustainability to review HSE and/or Quality pertinent sections, Risk Management to review insurance requirements, etc.) c. Commercial, collectively referring to any pricing information, including \u2013 for example - daily rates, lump sum fees and other charges (e.g. equipment rental rates, call-out rates for specialized manpower, etc.). +-----------+--------------------------------+------+---------+------+ | | Title | Revi | R | | | Document | | sion | evision | Page | | No. | APPENDIX C: Proposal | | Date | | | | deliverables, drilling | 1 | 12/ | 2 | | C | services | | 07/2022 | of | | C.PRO.001 | | | | 2 | +===========+================================+======+=========+======+ +-----------+--------------------------------+------+---------+------+ All commercials shall be based on the commercial model (aka. \u2018Bid Sheet\u2019) and shall be easily decipherable (calculable, or formula-based, and not hard-keyed). Developing and maintaining an up-to-date version of bid model at all times is central to preparation of any commercial Proposal. This process starts immediately after tender documents or project specific requirements are distributed to Proposal Team and continues as the Proposal is being developed. The parties responsible for commercial model preparation shall keep CCM personnel appraised of their work to ensure the alignment of the commercial model to contractual redlines and structure."}
